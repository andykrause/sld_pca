## What I Did

* Ran a host of models on King County home sales from 2017 to end of 2019
    * Linear and Random Forest Models
    * Variety of different specifications aimed at teasing out the marginal contribution of the SLD variables
* Extracted measures of impact from each variable in each model
    * Linear = coefficient values
    * Random Forest = Partial Dependency analysis on each SLD variable
* Summarized model performance
    * Model Fit (adj R-squared)
    * Predictive Ability: Median Absolute Percent Error (MdAPE)
            * Out-of-time prediction on last month in the data
    * Spatial Autocorrelation of Errors (SPAC): Moran's I Statistic, lower is better
    * Predictive Ability of Sales Near Submarket Boundary (Border MdAPE)

## Interpreting the SLD Impact

The plot below shows the impact (in % terms) of each of the SLD variables in four different model specifications:

* Linear (Blue) vs Random Forest (Orange)
* SLD as only spatial variable (Solid Line) vs SLD with X,Y and Submarket Fixed Effects (Dashed)

Broad takeaways:

* SLDs 1, 2 and 4 are positive, 3 and 5 negative
* The magitude of the impacts are greatly reduced when other spatial control features are added, but still remain (other than SLD 4)
* Linear and Random Forest models show similar directionality in all cases and roughly similar magnitude for all SLD variables except SLD 2 where the linear model suggests a much larger impact than the random forest models.
* SLDs 1, 3 and 5 show an 'S' curve in the random forest impacts suggesting that even with the standardization the linear model is missing some variation across the spectrum of SLD variable values.

### Model Performance

Next, I looked at how well the SLD features helped a variety of model performance indicators. 

Key takeaways:

* Model fit and predictive abilty are highly correlated, will just talk about predictions
* SLD variables don't add much to model performance in linear model
* Impacts of SLD variables on model performance much more significant in random forest model
* Submarket fixed effects are hard to beat in a linear model
* Submarket fixed effects are much less effective than X,Y coordinates and/or SLD variables in random forest
* All model show significant spatial autocorrelation
* Analysis of Border properties is inconclusive...needs a bit more work here.

  summary_tbl
```

```{r}

  mdape_tbl <- summary_df %>%
  dplyr::select(model, spec, mdape) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(model = ifelse(model == 'rf', 'Random Forest', 'OLS')) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = 'model', id_cols = 'spec', values_from = 'mdape')
